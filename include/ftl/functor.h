	 * \page functorpg Functor
	 *
	 * Abstraction of contexts that can be mapped to.
	 *
	 * Mathematically, functors are mappings from one category to another,
	 * following a set of well defined laws. What this means in FTL is that
	 * partial types (ie, vector is partial, vector<int> is complete) can often
	 * be made functors by giving a means of mapping a morphism (function) from
	 * the "pure" universe of plain types, to its own internal type universe.
	 *
	 * Ie, \c int is a plain type, \c vector<int> is an \c int "trapped" in the
	 * context of \c vector, and the mapping should apply the function "inside"
	 * that context. The most obvious way of doing so would be to apply the
	 * mapped function to every element in the vector.
	 *
	 * All instances of Functor should follow the laws below (which are part
	 * of the mathematical definition from which this concept is derived):
	 * - **Preservation of identity**
	 *   \code
	 *     map(id<T>, t)          <=> t
	 *   \endcode
	 * - **Preservatin of composition**
	 *   \code
	 *     map(compose(f, g), t)  <=> compose(curry(map)(f), curry(map)(g))(t)
	 *   \endcode
	 *
	 * \see \ref functor (module)
