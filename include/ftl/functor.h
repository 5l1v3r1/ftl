	 * \brief Abstraction of data types that can be "mapped to".
	 *
	 * \code
	 *   #include <ftl/functor.h>
	 * \endcode
	 *
	 * Mathematically, functors are mappings from one category to another,
	 * following a set of well defined laws. What this means in FTL is that
	 * partial types (ie, vector is partial, vector<int> is complete) can often
	 * be made functors by giving a means of mapping a morphism (function) from
	 * the "pure" universe of plain types, to its own internal type universe.
	 *
	 * Ie, \c int is a plain type, \c vector<int> is an \c int "trapped" in the
	 * context of \c vector, and the mapping should apply the function "inside"
	 * that context. The most obvious way of doing so would be to apply the
	 * mapped function to every element in the vector.
	 *
	 * All instances of Functor should follow the following laws (which are part
	 * of the mathematical definition from which this concept is derived):
	 * - given
	 *   \code
	 *     template<typename T>
	 *     T id(T t) { return t; }
	 *   \endcode
	 *   then,
	 *   \code
	 *     map(id<T>, t)          <=> t
	 *     map(compose(f, g), t)  <=> compose(curry(map)(f), curry(map)(g))(t)
	 *   \endcode
	 *

	/**
	 * \interface functor
	 *
	 * \brief Struct that must be specialised to implement the functor concept.
	 *
	 * When specialising, it is important to remember that the described
	 * interface here is _minimal_, and an instance is encouraged to include
	 * additional overloads of the functions for optimization reasons and
	 * similar. For types that cannot be copied, for instance, it makes sense
	 * that all of the functor interface functions accept an rvalue reference.
	 *
	 * \note There exists a second functor interface struct, declared as
	 *       \code
	 *       template<template<typename> class F>
	 *       struct functor<F> { ... };
	 *       \endcode
	 *       The reason for this is that it is presently impossible to unify the
	 *       two signatures, and FTL must allow functors to be parameterised on
	 *       more than just the type they're a functor in. Each member of the
	 *       interface will further document how the second version looks.
