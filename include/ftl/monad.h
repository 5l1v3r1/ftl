	 * \page monadpg Monad
	 *
	 * Abstraction of sequenceable computations in some context.
	 *
	 * Monads are essentially just a functor with some additional structure.
	 * Specifically, types that are monads have the added functionality (on top
	 * of what applicative adds) of sequencing computations in the context of
	 * the monad.
	 *
	 * While this is technically already possible in C++, the abstraction is
	 * useful none the less, because monads also have the power to implicitly
	 * pass state or other useful context information forward, without the user
	 * having to bother with it. 
	 *
	 * The easiest example of the above is probably the maybe monad, where the
	 * user does not need to manually check for nothingness except at the very
	 * end of a sequence of computations&mdash;because maybe's implementation of
	 * monad<M>::bind does that for them.
	 *
	 * As with many of the other concepts in FTL, monads have a set of
	 * associated laws that instances must follow (though technically, there is
	 * nothing enforcing them):
	 * - **Left identity law**
	 *   \code
	 *     pure(x) >>= f    <=> f(x)
	 *   \endcode
	 * - **Right identity law**
	 *   \code
	 *     m >>= pure<T>    <=> m
	 *   \endcode
	 * - **Law of associativity**
	 *   \code
	 *     (m >>= f) >>= g) <=> m >>= ([f](X x){return f(x);} >>= g)
	 *   \endcode
	 *
	 * \see \ref monad (module)
