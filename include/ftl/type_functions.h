	 *
	 * \section Introduction
	 * FTL is a pure template library (i.e., there is no linking to it,
	 * there are only headers to include) that draws heavy inspiration from
	 * Haskell and its libraries.
	 *
	 * \section Goals
	 * The primary goal of the FTL is to give users of C++ access to the various
	 * abstractions commonly available in functional languages. The secondary
	 * goal is to accomplish the above without disrupting or overthrowing the
	 * existing stdlib, instead preferring to _extend_ it whenver possible.
	 *
	 * \section Usage
	 * Because FTL is a pure template library, there is no need to link to
	 * anything special or jump through other hoops to get things to work.
	 * Merely include the header of the desired module(s), either by adding
	 * the include/ directory of the FTL library to your compiler's include
	 * path, or by placing the desired headers anywhere you like that is
	 * already in the include path. The former is the recommended practice.
	 *
	 * To compile a project using FTL, you need to make sure your compiler
	 * supports the required C++11 features and is set to use them. As of this
	 * writing, that is, to the author's knowledge, _only_ gcc versions 4.7 and
	 * later. To tell gcc your project uses C++11 features, add `-std=c++11` to
	 * its compilation flags.

	/**
	 * \defgroup modules Modules
	 *
	 * The various top level modules of the library.
	 *
	 * Each module can be completely brought into scope by a single `#include`
	 * statement. There is, however, some inter-dependence between the modules
	 * and thus, the various additional headers that will be included by each
	 * module shall be documented under the apropriate section.
