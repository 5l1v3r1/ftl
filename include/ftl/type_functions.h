	 *
	 * \section Introduction
	 * FTL is a pure template library (i.e., there is no linking to it,
	 * there are only headers to include) that draws heavy inspiration from
	 * Haskell and its libraries.
	 *
	 * \section Goals
	 * The primary goal of the FTL is to give users of C++ access to the various
	 * abstractions commonly available in functional languages. The secondary
	 * goal is to accomplish the above without disrupting or overthrowing the
	 * existing stdlib, instead preferring to _extend_ it whenver possible.
	 *
	 * \section Usage
	 * Because FTL is a pure template library, there is no need to link to
	 * anything special or jump through other hoops to get things to work.
	 * Merely include the header of the desired module(s), either by adding
	 * the include/ directory of the FTL library to your compiler's include
	 * path, or by placing the desired headers anywhere you like that is
	 * already in the include path. The former is the recommended practice.
	 *
	 * To compile a project using FTL, you need to make sure your compiler
	 * supports the required C++11 features and is set to use them. As of this
	 * writing, that is, to the author's knowledge, _only_ gcc versions 4.7 and
	 * later. To tell gcc your project uses C++11 features, add `-std=c++11` to
	 * its compilation flags.

	/**
	 * \page container Container
	 *
	 * Anything that is a container of elements of some type. In FTL, this
	 * concept is quite relaxed compared to its definition in the standard
	 * library. Here, a Container is simply anything that provides a forward
	 * iterable interface (both `const` and non-`const`), i.e., `begin()` and
	 * `end()`, as well as a `value_type` type definition.
	 *
	 * Often, you'll see other parts of the documentation refer to Container
	 * with a "template parameter". This means that an additional constraint is
	 * put on the container, namely that its `value_type` must match the given
	 * parameter.

	/**
	 * \page deref Dereferenceable
	 *
	 * Types that are dereferenceable.
	 *
	 * A type is dereferenceable if it has pointer-like semantics. That is, at
	 * minimum, it must define `operator bool`, `operator*`, and `operator->`.
	 *
	 * The behaviour of these should be as expected, in the context of the type
	 * in question. `operator bool` should, for instance, be usable to check if
	 * a particular value of the type is _valid_, as in, it's in a usable state
	 * where dereferencing it with the other operators will not throw or cause
	 * undefined behaviour.
