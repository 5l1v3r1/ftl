	 * The reason this works might not be immediately obvious, but basically,
	 * any function (regardless of arity) that returns a value that is an
	 * instance of monoid, is in fact also a monoid. It works as follows:
	 * \code
	 *   id() <=> A function, returning monoid<result_type>::id(),
	 *            regardless of parameters.
	 *   append(a,b) <=> A function that forwards its arguments to both a and b,
	 *                   and then calls monoid<result_type>::append on the two
	 *                   results.
	 * \endcode
